1. LSTM + Sentiment Analysis + Conformal prediction Stock Price Prediction
To enhance the accuracy of LSTM model predictions for stocks, gold, and potential index funds, researchers have incorporated sentiment analysis of daily news headlines using the BERT model, recognizing the significant influence of media on stock markets. To further improve the reliability of these predictions, they have implemented the Conformal Prediction technique, a statistical method that provides prediction intervals with a guaranteed coverage probability. By setting the coverage at 90%, this approach ensures that the true value falls within the predicted interval 90% of the time, offering a robust measure of uncertainty for financial forecasts. This combination of advanced natural language processing and statistical techniques aims to provide more comprehensive and reliable predictions in the volatile world of financial markets.
